# Running your very own PhenomeCentral.org instance

# Installation

Requires:

- vagrant
- ansible
- virtualbox

The machine must have around 50gb of disk space. (Exomiser itself takes
up 25). `setup.sh` configures virtualbox, but if you're running vagrant on
another provider, this task is up to you.

Run:

    ./setup.sh
